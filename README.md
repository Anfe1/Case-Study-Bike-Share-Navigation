# Case-Study-Bike-Share-Navigation
This is a data analysis project that deals with bike-share data. In this project, we were tasked with providing insights on how members and non-members of the 
bike-share program behave. I looked at data provided by google's certificate project to proceed with the analysis. The data spans over a year and it contains 
types of members, ride types, ride starting times, and ride ending times. The analysis process includes creating a column for ride length time, days of the week,
and month data. 

The visualization results have been added as pdfs for the public to see, it includes 5 graphs that were derived directly from the python code.
